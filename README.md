# blockchain-dev-docs
Some documents I created for those learning blockchain development.

- ***BlockchainDevNotes*** -- a collection of my personal notes on using Hardhat to develop 
blockchain dApps with Solidity smart contracts and a React.js front-end. I must credit 
**Dapp University** for much of the learnings in these notes.  Check out their YouTube 
channel if you want to learn Ethereum-based blockchain development!

- ***BlockchainOpenSourceProjects.xlsx*** -- a spreadsheet containing Open Source projects 
related to blockchain which are in active development and open to new contributors.
If you are trying to land your first job as a blockchain developer, being a code 
contributor to a blockchain project will boost your resume!

- ***Revisions.md*** -- revision history for the docs here.


## Disclaimer
I am still relatively new to blockchain development while compiling these notes. I 
believe they are correct, and I still refer to them a lot myself, but use them at your 
own risk! I make no warranties of any kind, and your use of these documents constitutes agreement 
that I am not responsible for any blockchain mis-haps or financial loss or reputation
loss, or any other losses that occur as a result.

Happy blockchain learnings!
